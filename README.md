# IAESTE_AC_app
Applet to check interest in certain offers and keep track of exchange offers during the IAESTE Annual Conference.
Feel free to download, adjust and use!

This app currently still needs to be started from the command line, by running ```python ACExchangeGUIs.py```. After this, a file containing student preferences can be chosen to use. Based on this file, the app will look for students from a certain field interested in a certain region. An example data file is included on the repository and is set as default file when starting up the application.

Quite a few things are still hard-coded in this app; chances it works with files from another format are small. Especially the columns 'Preferred country 1' and 'Study Field' should be present in the .csv-file presented, under that name.
